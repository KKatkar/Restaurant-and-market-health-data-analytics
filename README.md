# LA-Restaurant-and-Market-health-data-analytics
To identify the trends through which we will be able to determine the level of compliance with the healthcare standards amongst restaurants and markets within the specified region. This project will form the general structure through which the end-user will be able to establish a concrete overview of the healthcare violations and derive the tendencies over multiple dimensions.

<h2>Description</h2>
This project deals with datasets larger than 300,000+ tuples consisting of historical data. With the help of such datasets, deriving insights from data is more accurate. This project analyzes different violations observed at restaurants and their severity levels and derives trends accordingly. Analyzing and plotting charts on such data requires huge operational costs without the support of a repository. Hence leveraging a database makes this process easy with efficient query processing.

Once the data is analyzed and stored in the database, queries performed on the front end are served faster. Interfacing the front end software with a database saves computation time which results in a quick turnaround. Users will be able to access the database through the front end system.



<h3>Assumptions</h3>
Data for restaurant inspections are reported every quarter. In case of the absence of this information, a restaurant would be assumed as 100% compliant for a particular quarter
<br />

<h3>Functionalities</h3>

● Representing data through trends - Identifying and plotting trends of violations observed at restaurants or markets over a specific time period.
